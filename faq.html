<p>I got this idea from the <a href="http://www.simplynailogical.com/p/faqs.html">Simply Nailogical FAQ</a>, I borrowed some questions and sarcasm from her superior blog site.</p>

<button class="accordion">Unbelieveable Nail Polish</button>
<div class="panel">
  <ol>
  	<li>Favorite nail polish?</li>
  		<ul>
      		<li><a href="http://www.essie.com/effects/mirror-metallics/no-place-like-chrome.aspx">Essie's No Place Like Chrome</a>. I love ~all~ multichrome and holo polishes, too. I love all nail polishes people give me for free. I hate the smell of Poparazzi opaque car paint nail polish.</li>
    	</ul>
    <br>
  	<li>Favorite top coat?</li>
  		<ul>
 			<li>I don't have one, oops. I've been using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sally-Hansen-Coat-Dries-Instantly/dp/B00SG6YD7Q/ref=sr_1_6_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1514857270&sr=1-6&keywords=sally%2Bhansen%2Bquick%2Bdry%2Btop%2Bcoat&th=1">Sally Hansen's Dries Instantly</a> top coat and it hasn't failed me yet. Then I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revlon-Ultimate-Shine-Top-Coat/dp/B01FIL5T2E?th=1">Revlon's Ultimate Shine Top Coat</a> to make things extra super glossy wow.</li> 	
  		</ul>
  	<br>
  	<li>Favorite base coat?</li>
  		<ul>
  			<li>I also don't have one, oops. Previously I used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revlon-Quick-Dry-Base-Coat/dp/B01FIL5YN8/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1514857573&sr=1-1&keywords=revlon+base+coat">Revlon's Quick Dry Base Coat</a> and then I bought <a href="http://www.essie.com/nail-care/primers/color-corrector-for-nails.aspx">Essies Primer</a>
  				when that bottle ran out. I will keep using them until I pay off my student loans.
  			</li>
  		</ul>
  	<br>
  	<li>Favorite matte top coat?</li>
  		<ul>
  			<li>Probably <a href="https://www.beyondpolish.com/products/essie-matte-about-you-6092?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=googlepla&variant=1740731459&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyKzwypW42AIVRyOBCh36mACIEAQYASABEgK4yfD_BwE">Essie's Matte About You</a>? I don't do matte nails too often because I use glitter, the herpes of arts and crafts, on my nails.</li>
  		</ul>
  	<br>
  	<li>Favorite nail polish brand?</li>
  		<ul>
  			<li><a href="https://www.cirquecolors.com">Cirque Colors</a> is beautiful and I love it and they make my favorite black polish <a href="https://www.cirquecolors.com/memento-mori/">Memento Mori.</a></li>	
  		</ul>
  	<br>
  	<li>Where do you get your nail polishes?</li>
  		<ul>
  			<li>Either CVS (my second favorite place in the entire worlds behind WalMart because I'm a Taurus and materialism consumes me) for the bulk of my regular nail polishes or <a href="https://www.livelovepolish.com">Live Love Polish</a> for the nail polishes that blow my mind andalso wallet.

	<ol>
  		<li>What do you take pictures and make videos with?</li>
  		  	<ul>
  				<li>Before August 2018, I used a Canon PowerShot S3 that was made in 2007. My dad got it at Goodwill for $15 dollars. It gets the job done when it's four AA batteries don't run out. 
            Now that I have a Real Job, I use the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Camera-18-55mm-Premium-Accessory-Bundle/dp/B01N7N1C3U/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1514858350&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=canon+rebel+t6&psc=1"> Canon Rebel T6</a> with an 85mm off brand lens.</li>
  			</ul>
  		<br>
  		<li>What kind of lighting do you use?</li>
  		  	<ul>
  				<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LimoStudio-Photography-Continuous-Portable-Filters/dp/B00RKJ0ZFE/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1514858537&sr=1-2&keywords=light+lamp+photo">This really cheap lighting kit from Amazon.</a> It does, in fact, produce light. I don't use a soft box because I want the light to reflect the sparkles in my nail polish.</li>
  			</ul>
  		<br>
  		<li>Where do you get your backgrounds?</li>
  		  	<ul>
  				<li>The clearance section of my local Michael's craft store.</li>
  			</ul>
  		<br>
  		<li>What do you edit with?</li>
  		  	<ul>
  				<li>I run a dual boot Windows/Linux, and since Linux hasn't caught up to the nail art video editing world and I must use Windows, I paid money for the <a href="https://www.movavi.com/videoeditor/">Movavi Video Editor</a> and I did not pay money for <a href="https://www.fotor.com">Fotor</a> and <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/features.html">paint.net</a>. (Yes I've tried GIMP, yes I prefer Windows Paint). I get my music for the two videos I made once off the public domain world like everyone else who can't license things.

<button class="accordion">Unpopular About Me</button>
<div class="panel">
 	<ol>
	  	<li>How many nail polish bottles do you have?</li>
	  	  	<ul>
  				<li>Last time I counted, over 200. Spreadsheet for my ~wonderful polishes~ coming soon!</li>
  			</ul>
  		<br>
	  	<li>How did you come up with the name "Undenailable"?</li>
	  	  	<ul>
  				<li>It used to be dianailsit, but then someone misread it as Diana Is Lit so I decided never again. My dear squadfam friend gave me the name Undenailable. Trademark coming soon.</li>
  			</ul>
  		<br>
	  	<li>Do you get paid to do this?</li>
	  	  	<ul>
  				<li>No, I have no real influence over anyone.</li>
  			</ul>
  		<br>
	  	<li>Why did you start this blog if you only have like two followers?</li>
	  	  	<ul>
  				<li>Oh no! You're right! What was I thinking? Time to shut this whole thing down.</li>
  			</ul>
  		<br>
	  	<li>When did you start doing nail art?</li>
	  	  	<ul>
  				<li>When I was in 6th grade I made 4th of July nail art by spelling out letters on my nails that read "I ‚ù§ A M E R I C A !" and it all went downhill from there.</li>
  			</ul>
  		<br>
	  	<li>Will you do my nails?</li>
	  	  	<ul>
  				<li>I will only do them for free if we are friends. Otherwise, it would be an awkward two hours.</li>
  			</ul>
  		<br>
	  	<li>Vim or Emacs?</li>

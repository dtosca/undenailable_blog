<p>Hello, World! Welcome to my site that is hard to find because it is not indexed on Google yet! Yay!</p>

<p>Today I will be sharing my nail art routine secrets. And by secrets, I mean things I heard YouTubers and nail art people talk about that is supposed to help nails.</p>

<p>Here are all the products I generally use when trying to make sure my nails don't break and send me into the nub club:</p>

<p>This is not sponsored because if it was I would be doing nail art all day instead of going to college, slowly depriving myself of sleep and sanity.</p>

<h4>Removing Nail Polish</h4>

<p>There are appearently wrong ways to remove nail polish. Wrong way number one: biting off or chipping off the nail polish. If you start picking it off, the top layers of your nails flake off with it. Then your nails will be weaker, more prone to breaking, and suddenly your life is headed toward a never ending spiral downwards.</p>

<p>The way I remove my nail polish is with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/10PC-Plastic-Acrylic-Polish-Remover/dp/B00PXUOHA6">these magical soak off nail clips.</a> I'll start by oiling up my nails and surrounding skin using the inexpensive <a href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/beauty-360-almond-oil-cuticle-pen-0-06-oz-prodid-1015158?skuId=924521">Beauty 360 Cuticle Softener</a> or some baby oil to prevent the acetone from drying out my skin. Then I'll use 100% pure acetone(not 98% Nail Remover Bullshit) on a cotton pad and place it over the nails. I secure the nail clips to my nails and leave them on for three to five minutes. Then I remove the clips, slide the cotton pad off my nail, and most of the polish should come off. This method allows the acetone to dissolve the nail polish so you avoid scrubbing the finger with acetone.</p>

<p>If I used a glitter polish, I will generally use the <a href="https://www.livelovepolish.com/products/unt-ready-for-takeoff-peel-off-base-coat">UNT Peel Off Base Coat.</a> I once didn't do that and spent fourty five minutes scraping off my glitter nail polish in the communal college bathroom. People stared at me and everything smelled like acetone for generations to come. It was great.</p>

<h4>Removing the Cuticle</h4>

<p>To remove the cuticle, I do not clip them because I like my nails infection-free. I use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sally-Hansen-Instant-Cuticle-Remover/dp/B0046MK34G">Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover</a> because idk CVS had it. It works well, I think, but I've literally never used anything else. I leave the blue gel on for fifteen seconds on each cuticle then scrape off the dead skin with the wooden stick. Then when that doesn't work I'll take my nails and scrape off the remaining cuticle with my fingers because it's so much more satisfying. Then I wash my hands because otherwise the blue gel will eat off all your skin, yum.</p>

<h4>Filing</h4>

<p>I've been using a crystal nail file every since I got ~serious~ about nail art because they never get dull. I got mine from CVS because it's my second favorite place in the world. I file my nails into a square shape. The trick is to not do the thing people do in the movies and see-saw file your nails. You should file in one direction. I usually don't clip my nails for the standard weekly filing because this can bend the nail and thats not cool. Sometimes I will clip them because I like to break my own rules.</p>

<h4>Lotions and Nail Oils</h4>

<p>Oh no, the way my hands look matters now! Damn!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, me doing nail art means I am hand vain and I take many pictures of my hands. So I need to take care of them. Oops.</p>

<p>Now that I live mostly in New England my life is much colder and dryer. My dumb ass didn't understand the need for lotion or gloves my first year. So my hands were super dry, cracked, and rough due to my dumbassery. I have since become enlightened. I either use the <a href="http://www.myblisskiss.com/simply-sealed-lotion-stick-large/">Bliss Kiss Lotion Stick</a> or a normal liquidly lotion that I got as a sample somewhere. I also wear gloves when I go outside in the winter times. If I am feeling very extra, I'll put on Nivea hand cream, put on cotton gloves, and then sleep in them. I wake up with soft hands yay. There is a chance I tore them off in my sleep, though.</p>

<p>I'll put on nail oil to keep my cuticles from looking crusty and to make my nails more flexible. I've used <a href="http://www.myblisskiss.com/simply-pure-hydrating-oil-15-ml-dropper-bottle/">Bliss Kiss Nail Oil</a> for most of my nail art life, but I've recently ordered pure Jojoba oil and Vitamin E. I will test that out on my nails in the next couple of weeks. I'll be sure to let all two of you reading this know how that goes because it's cheaper and I like money to pay off my student loans.

<p>And there you have it, that's how I take care of my nails. But honestly, I don't keep my nails very long because I have instruments to play and computer science typing to do. So what I'm doing is possibly for nothing because I don't need my nails to not break. RIP me.</p>

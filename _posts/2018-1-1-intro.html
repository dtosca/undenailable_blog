<p>Hello, World! Welcome to the corner of the internet that includes my nail art. I don't know how you found it, but congratulations on making it to the Deep Web.</p>

<p>This is my blog dedicated to talking about whatever I want related to nail art, probably. While building this site, I started looking at all my old nail photos. I have documented all the nail art I have ever done ~wow~ (if I ever find the photo of the first nail art piece I did in 6th grade, I'll share it here). I'll start off the fun by roasting myself on mistakes I use to make in my nail art but don't anymore. If you want to see all the bad things I did, check out my nail photo <a href="archives">archives</a> of pride and shame.</p>

<p>When I first started off in the wonderful world of nail art, I didn't actually know how to paint my nails. I use to just smear it over my fingers and hope for the best. It was all very messy because lol what did I know. Spending hours on The Youtubes instead of doing homework taught me some tricks about putting on nail polish. </p>

<h4>Prep Work</h4>

<p>If you want the polish to adhere better, you'll want to remove oils from the top of your finger nails. I like to take a Q tip soaked in 100% acetone and rub it on the top of my nails. Pro tip: 100% acetone is sooo much better than nail polish remover that is like 98% acetone. Idk what happened in that 2% but, trust me, it works better.</p>

<h4>Painting My Nails</h4>

<p>Don't glop on a heavy coat in the hopes of making something opaque faster. It will probably never dry and then you'll get the weird bed sheet marks on your nails that I used to get. The trick is to get a sparing amount of polish on the brush. Dip the brush in the bottle, stroke one side of the brush along the inside of the bottle,the dot the other side of the brush on the inside of the bottle. Now you have the perfect amount of polish on the brush, wow, amazing, magic, art!</p>

<p>I paint my nails in three strokes: down the middle of the nail, then down either side. I don't let the polish touch my skin. I always leave a little gap to make things look neater during cleanup. This also allows for the top coat to go over the entire design, past the gap you left but not toward the skin or cuticle area.</p>

<h4>Top and Base Coats</h4>

<p>Also, for the love of Holo, use a base coat and top coat!!! I mean, like, yeah, you do you fam; if you don't need one becuase your nail polish never chips away then 10 out of 10 for you. But for the rest of us peasents (me), who can't get their nail polish to stay on for severl days without chips, using a base coat and top coat are essential. Don't get the two in one base/top coat, though. They are garbage. Base coats are meant to adhere to the natural nail, top coats are meant to adhere to the laquer. Don't forget to run the brush along the white part of the nail to help it stay on longer. Professionals call this "capping the free edges". </p>

<h4>Cleanup!</h4>

<p>One GIANT thing I neglected to do in most of my early work is cleaning up along the edge of my nails. It's pretty easy to do. Take a nail art brush or an eyeliner brush and dip it in some acetone. Run it along the top and sides of your nails. It makes everything look 300% cleaner and I didn't do it before and now we are all sad. Here is my own nail example:</p>

<p>This was also the time I put down nail vinyls to make the wavy design without putting a top coat on first. The vinyl ripped my base polish off. I learned the hard way to not do that, rest in pieces to the hours of my life I will never get back for the sake of art.</p>

<p>tl;dr The moral of this is to say everyone starts somewhere. We all make nail mistakes. I'm definitely not a nail expert but I hope you and me and everyone will be happy with what they can do. I'm not saying don't strive to do better, but it's good to look at all you have accomplished so far and say "Wow I'm a 10/10 on progress and I like what I'm doing." I know the world of the ~instagrams~ can make people (read:me) insecure, but art is art. Fun is fun. Because nail art is supposed to be fun! Happy Holodays and New Years, friends.</p>

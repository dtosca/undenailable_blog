<p>Hello, World! Welcome to my corner of the interwebs. </p>

<p>Today, I will show you how to make your nails look as awesome as mine using words and not videos because my camera sucks and refuses to focus. If I ever become unpoor and get a new camera I'll let all two of you reading this know.</p>

<p>For now, LOOK AT MY NAILS WOW.</p>

<p>Isn't that trippy?</p>

<p>For all of you not in the nail art world, this is called a reciprocal gradient, because it reciprocates(?). Idk I didn't make up those words. For more on gradients, read Simply Nailogical's <a href="http://www.simplynailogical.com/p/gradient-g.html">very confusing but practical gradient guide.</a></p>

<p>I started off with a <a href="https://www.livelovepolish.com/products/unt-ready-for-takeoff-peel-off-base-coat">Peel Off Base Coat.</a></p>

<p>Pro Tip: Don't do what I did. A peeloff basecoat is ~fine~ if you're not using nail vinyls or striping tape...but I was. So unless you want to be sad when your manicure is pulled off, use a normal base coat. </p>

<p>Why did I use one, you ask? I felt like challenging the nail Gods. But I did end up having to redo my pinky for my sins.</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.livelovepolish.com/collections/vegan-nail-polish/products/live-love-polish-lbd-nail-polish">the black polish LBD</a> and <a href="https://www.livelovepolish.com/products/live-love-polish-lbd-nail-polish">the white polish Linen</a> from Live Love Polish. The black is opaque in one coat (gasp!). I would say the white is opaque in two coats.</p>

<p>Then I painted my nails white, I'm very creative. I put on a quick dry top coat after that to prevent the base coat from lifting up when I peel away the striping tape.</p>

<p>Next, I put on a layer of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PUEEN-Cuticle-Barrier-Protector-BH000584/dp/B016LIABMQ/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_121_bs_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=019PP07T0T61H5ATK2AF">liquid latex</a> to protect my skin from nail polish gradient disasters. More pro tips: Don't do this with a peeloff basecoat because the liquid latex might stick to the base coat. And it did for me. And I was sad. The end. *shakes fist at nail Gods*</p>

<p>Now for the fun part, the ~gradients~</p>

<img src="img/1_15_18_nails/gradient_sponge.jpg" alt="sponge" height="500" width="500">

<p>I painted a sponge. I put that sponge on my nails. It looked like a gradient. I'm so happy T_T</p>

<img src="img/1_15_18_nails/gradient.jpg" alt="gradient" height="500" width="500">

<p>Then I put on tiny pieces of striping tape on my nails. I don't usually use striping tape becase I have nail vinlys and stamping plates, but these let you have more creative freedom (or so I hear).</p>

<p>And then I make the reciprocal part happen. I put on the graduent again, but in the reverse order! Woah! I'm so innovative, I know. It took me about two to three coats to get this blended.</p>

<p>Then it's over. You're done. Nail art. It's magic.</p>

<p>This took me like two hours because nail art is hard. You can't rush ~art~ trust me, I've tried.</p>

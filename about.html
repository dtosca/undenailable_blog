<h4>Hi, I'm Diana.</h4>

<p>I'm a recent college grad and I really, really, really like nail art.</p>

<p>I'm originally from Miami, FL (y soy Cubana)!</p>

<p>I moved to New England to study Music and Computer Science and ~wow it's so cold all the time help~</p>

<p>My current real adult job is doing research for a Human-Computer Interaction lab.</p>

<p>Some not nail related things I like include functional programming, all things makeup, Super Smash Bros, making music, and my doggo Princess.</p>

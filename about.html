<h4>Hi, I'm Diana.</h4>

<p>I'm a senior in college and I really, really, really like nail art.</p>

<p>I'm originally from Miami, FL (y soy Cubana :D).</p>

<p>I moved to New England to study Music and Computer Science ~wow it's so cold all the time help~</p>

<p>Other not nail related things I like include functional programming, all things makeup, the game Terraria, cooking, and my doggo Princess.</p>
